# **Operators**

Operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables/operands and values. 
```python
# Add: 
print(5 + 6)
# 5 and 6 are operands, + is an operator.

a = 5
b = 6
print(a + b)
# a and b are variables, + is an operator.
```

### **Arithmetic Operators**

Operator | Operation | Example
:--- | :--- | :---
`+` | Addition | `print(a + b)`
`-` | Subtraction | `print(a - b)`
`*` | Multiplication | `print(a * b)`
`/` | Division (floor quotient) | `print(a / b)`
`//` | Floor Division (int quotient) | `print(a // b)`
`%` | Modulo (Remmainder) | `print(a % b)`
`**` | Power | `print(a ** b)`

```python
a = 7
b = 2

# addition
print ('Sum: ', a + b)  

# subtraction
print ('Subtraction: ', a - b)   

# multiplication
print ('Multiplication: ', a * b)  

# division
print ('Division: ', a / b) 

# floor division
print ('Floor Division: ', a // b)

# modulo
print ('Modulo: ', a % b)  

# a to the power b
print ('Power: ', a ** b)

# output:
Sum: 9
Subtraction: 5
Multiplication: 14
Division: 3.5
Floor Division: 3
Modulo: 1
Power: 49
```
