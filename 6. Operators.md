# **Operators**

Operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables/operands and values. 
```python
# Add: 
print(5 + 6)
# 5 and 6 are operands, + is an operator.

a = 5
b = 6
print(a + b)
# a and b are variables, + is an operator.
```

### **Arithmetic Operators**

Operator | Operation | Example
:--- | :--- | :---
`+` | Addition | `print(a + b)`
`-` | Subtraction | `print(a - b)`
`*` | Multiplication | `print(a * b)`
`/` | Division (floor quotient) | `print(a / b)`
`//` | Floor Division (int quotient) | `print(a // b)`
`%` | Modulo (Remmainder) | `print(a % b)`
`**` | Power | `print(a ** b)`

```python
a = 7
b = 2

# Addition (+)
print('Sum: ', a + b)  

# Subtraction (-)
print('Subtraction: ', a - b)   

# Multiplication (*)
print('Multiplication: ', a * b)  

# Division (/)
print('Division: ', a / b) 

# Floor division (//)
print('Floor Division: ', a // b)

# Modulo (%)
print('Modulo: ', a % b)  

# Power (**)
print('Power: ', a ** b)

# output:
Sum: 9
Subtraction: 5
Multiplication: 14
Division: 3.5
Floor Division: 3
Modulo: 1
Power: 49
```

### **Assignment Operators**
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. 
Operator | Name |	Example
:--- | :--- | :---
`=`	| Assignment Operator |	`a = 7`
`+=` | Addition Assignment | `a += 1 # a = a + 1`
`-=` | Subtraction Assignment |	`a -= 3 # a = a - 3`
`*=` | Multiplication Assignment | `a *= 4 # a = a * 4`
`/=` | Division Assignment | `a /= 3 # a = a / 3`
`%=` | Remainder Assignment | `a %= 10 # a = a % 10`
`**=` |	Exponent Assignment |	`a **= 10 # a = a ** 10`

### **Comparison Operators**
Comparison operators compare two values/variables and return a boolean result: `True` or `False`
Operator | Meaning | Example
:--- | :--- | :---
`==` | Is Equal To | `3 == 5` gives us `False`
`!=` | Not Equal To | `3 != 5` gives us `True`
`>` | Greater Than | `3 > 5` gives us `False`
`<` |	Less Than |	`3 < 5` gives us `True`
`>=` | Greater Than or Equal To |	`3 >= 5` give us `False`
`<=` | Less Than or Equal To | `3 <= 5` gives us `True`

### **Logical Operators**
Logical operators are used to check whether an expression is `True` or `False`. They are used in decision-making.
Operator | Example | Meaning
:--- | :--- | :---
`and` |	a and b |	Logical `AND`: True only if both the operands are True
`or` | a or b |	Logical `OR`: True if at least one of the operands is True
`not` |	not a |	Logical `NOT`: True if the operand is False and vice-versa.

### **Special Operators**
**1. Identity operators**: 
- `is` and `is not` are used to check if two values are identical or not.

Operator | Meaning | Example
:--- | :--- |:---
`is` | `True` if the operands are identical (refer to the same object) | `x is True`
`is not` | `True` if the operands are not identical (do not refer to the same object) | `x is not True`

**2. Membership operators** 
- `in` and `not in` are the membership operators. 
- They are used to test whether a value or variable is found in a sequence (string, list, tuple, set and dictionary).
- In a dictionary, we can only test for the presence of a key, not the value.

Operator | Meaning | Example
:--- | :--- | :---
`in` | `True` if value/variable is found in the sequence | `5 in x`
`not in` | `True` if value/variable is not found in the sequence | `5 not in x`
