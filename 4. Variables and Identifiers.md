# **Variables**

- A variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.
- Python is a dynamically typed language, we don't have to explicitly define the data type for variables.
- We use the assignment operator `=` to assign a value to a variable.

```python
# name, age, email, is_female is a variable  storing the value 'Mandira', 25, 'iammandiravp@gmail.com', and True.
name = 'Mandira'
age = 25
email = 'iammandiravp@gmail.com'
is_female = True
```

We can also add a hint about the data types by using Python type hint.
```python
# type hint for variables:
name: str = 'Mandira'
age: int = 25
email: str = 'iammandiravp@gmail.com'
is_female: bool = True

# type hint for functions:
def sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:
  return a + b
```

### **Assigning multiple values to multiple variables**
Number of variables (left side) should be equal to the Number of values (right side) of the assignment operator `=`
```python
name, age, is_female = 'Mandira', 25, True
```

### Assign the same value to multiple variables at once
Assign same value to both the variables using assignment operator `=`
```python
email = contact = 'iammandiravp@gmail.com'
```
