# **Variables**

- A variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.
- Python is a dynamically typed language, we don't have to explicitly define the data type for variables.
- We use the assignment operator `=` to assign a value to a variable.

```python
# name, age, email, is_female is a variable  storing the value 'Mandira', 25, 'iammandiravp@gmail.com', and True.
name = 'Mandira'
age = 25
email = 'iammandiravp@gmail.com'
is_female = True
```

We can also add a hint about the data types by using Python type hint.
```python
# type hint for variables:
name: str = 'Mandira'
age: int = 25
email: str = 'iammandiravp@gmail.com'
is_female: bool = True

# type hint for functions:
def sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:
  return a + b
```

### **Assigning multiple values to multiple variables**
Number of variables (left side) should be equal to the Number of values (right side) of the assignment operator `=`
```python
name, age, is_female = 'Mandira', 25, True
```

### Assign the same value to multiple variables at once
Assign same value to both the variables using assignment operator `=`
```python
email = contact = 'iammandiravp@gmail.com'
```

# Literals
- Literals are representations of fixed values in a program.
- They can be numbers, characters, or strings, etc. For example, 'Hello, World!', 12, 23.0, 'C', etc.
- Literals are often used to assign values to variables or constants.

**1. Numeric Literals**
- Integer literals are numbers without decimal parts. It also consists of negative numbers.
- For example, 5, -11, 0, 12, etc.

**2. Floating Point Literals**
- Floating-point literals are numbers that contain decimal parts.
- Just like integers, floating-point numbers can also be both positive and negative.
- For example, 2.5, 6.76, 0.0, -9.45, etc.

**3. String Literals**
- In Python, texts wrapped inside quotation marks are called string literals.
- We can use single quotes and double quotes to create strings.
- For example, 'Mandira', "iammandiravp@gmail.com"

**4. Boolean Literals**
- There are two boolean literals: `True` and `False`
- For example: is_pass = True

**5. Character Literals**
- Character literals are unicode characters enclosed in a quote.
- For example, blood_group = 'A'

**6. Special Literals** 
- Python contains one special literal `None`. We use it to specify a `NULL` variable.
- For example, value = None

**7. Collection Literals**
- List, Tuple, Dict, and Set literals.
```python
# List literal:
fruits = ["apple", "mango", "orange"] 

# Tuple literal:
numbers = (1, 2, 3) 

# Dictionary literal:
alphabets = {'a':'apple', 'b':'ball', 'c':'cat'} 

# Set literal:
vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i' , 'o', 'u'} 
```
