# Python

**Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility.**

**High-level language:**  
- A programming language that is designed to make it easier for humans to understand and write.
- It is closer to natural human language and uses commands and instructions.
- Example: Python, Java, Ruby, Swift, JavaScript, etc.

**Low-level language:**
- A programming language that is closer to machine code and hardware than high-level languages.
- Example: C, C++, Assembly, Fortan, etc.

**Key Characteristics of Python:**

**1. Interpreted:** 
- Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter, making it easier to test and debug.

**2. Object Oriented Programming (OOP):** 
- Python supports OOP concepts, allowing you to model real-world entities as objects with attributes and methods.

**3. Dynamically typed:** 
- We don't need to declare variable date types beforehand, Python automatically determines them at runtime.

**4. Readability:** 
- Python's syntax emphasizes code clarity, using indentation for blocks instead of curly braces.

**5. Large standard libraries/modules:** 
- Python comes with a rich collection of built-in libraries for various tasks, saving you time and effort.

**6. Extensive ecosystem:**
- A vast array of third-party libraries and frameworks are available for specialized applications.
- Python’s ecosystem thrives on collaboration and knowledge-sharing (GitHub, Stackoverflow, Official websites)

**7. Extensive community and forums:**
- We’ll find ample resources, forums, and discussion groups to help you on your Python journey.
