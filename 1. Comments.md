# **Comments**

- Text written in a program/code which is not executed or ignored by the interpreter.
- Comments are initiated with `#` (Hash character). Python interprets anything after a `#` as a comment.
- Comments provide context for why something is written the way.
- Help others to read and understand the code faster. 

```
