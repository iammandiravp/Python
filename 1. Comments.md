# **Comments**

- Text written in a program or code which is not executed and ignored by the compiler or interpreter.
- Comments are initiated with `#` anything after a `#` is interpreted as a comment.
- Comments provide context for why something is written, help others to read and understand the code. 

```python
# This is a comment
# Following variables store the details for the employees:
name = 'Mandira'
age = 26
designation = 'Business Analyst'
is_single = True
```
